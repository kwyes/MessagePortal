    emailing <a href="mailto:admissions@bodwell.edu">admissions@bodwell.edu</a>
    if you have additional questions on admissions or Bodwell.
</p>
<p>
    You will start by clicking "<strong>Apply New</strong>" and filling in all
    the required fields. Later at the Upload step, you will need to provide us
    the following documents:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>
        Passport Copy (photo ID page)
    </li>
    <li>
        Transcript of your past 3 years
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Once all the documents are uploaded and the application is submitted, we
    will then set up an interview with you within a week. The purpose of the
    interview is to get to know you better and evaluate your acceptability for
    our school. We will be asking questions to understand your transcript,
    personality and motivations for coming to Bodwell and Canada.
